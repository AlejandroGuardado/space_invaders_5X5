Job interview game, made by Alejandro Guardado

## Features
- Level Data
  - Level layout and data loaded from ScriptableObjects.
  - Positions are set for each line. Pattern can be repeated. 
  - Enemies spawn after crossing a threshold.
- Session Data
  - Many gameplay variables can be changed in an ScriptableObject, improving game design iteration.
- Pool management
  - Instead of instancing objects on the fly, they're pooled and activated on demand.
  - Same pool class used by several types of game entities, thanks to polymorphism and generics.
    - Enemies
    - Bullets
    - Powerups
- Events
  - Unity and C# events used to communicate between modules, avoiding tight-coupling.
- Screen FSM
  - Finite State Machine used to control screen transitions.
  - Skip feature for debugging purposes (editor mode only).
- Custom Shaders
  - Custom Materials for Sprite Renderer.
  - Effects
    - Transitions
      - Transition effect between screens controlled by a Singleton manager.
      - Cut and fade transitions.
    - Dissolve effect
      - Player and enemies "dissolve" when destroyed.
      - GPU instancing, for dissolve cutoff animation.
    - Barriers
      - Hex pattern that reveals itself when the player approaches to show gameplay area bounds. Also, it changes color.
      - GPU instancing, to calculate distance to player.
	  - When player fires a gun, a "shockwave" expands barrier visibility.
- Player animation
  - Scale distort to improve feel of speed and force.
  - Activated with movement and gunfire.
- End screen
  - Victory and Game Over screen based on the same abstract class, acting on the same UI Canvas.
- Mobile Build
  - Android version only.
  - Touch input for menu, movement and gun.
  - Fire button used as extra indicator to show reload progress.
  >Bug: Sometimes, one of the arrow buttons gets stuck and the player ship moves by itself. I haven't found the cause yet.
- Powerups
  - Powerup item may drop randomly after an enemy is destroyed.
  - Types
    - Rapid Fire: Lower cooldown. Uses same class as the normal gun (only one value is different).
    - Triple Shot: Three shots at once. Overrides routine to accomplish this.
- Bonus
  - Bonus points by destroying enemies before they reach an specified line (value set in Session Data).
